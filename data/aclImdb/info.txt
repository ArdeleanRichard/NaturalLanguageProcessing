This dataset contains movie reviews and their associated scores (between
1 and 10) as provided by IMDb.5 Maas et al. converted these scores to
binary labels by assigning each review a positive or negative label if the
review score was above 6 or below 5, respectively. Reviews with scores
5 and 6 were considered too neutral and thus excluded. We follow the
same protocol in this chapter.
The dataset is divided in two even partitions called train and test,
each containing 25,000 reviews. The dataset also provides additional
unlabeled reviews, but we will not use those here. Each partition contains two directories called pos and neg where the positive and negative
examples are stored. Each review is stored in an independent text file,
whose name is composed of an id unique to the partition and the score
associated with the review, separated by an underscore.
